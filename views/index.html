1. Your content is really close to the edge of the page.  Have you considered aligning things differently?
   - maybe you want to use a Bootstrap 'container': http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid
2. What about your text?  Where did it come from?  Maybe you should add a reference to the source? I'm about to.
3. There is a lot of text together. You did that.
   - maybe you want to explore different Bootstrap text options?  http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-body-copy
4. Don't get me wrong, your button is stylish, but what about changing its font size or color?
   - check out the options: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons

Finally, you asked about Font Awesome icons.  Did you know that Font Awesome icons are embedded within
Bootstrap?  They call them 'Glyphicons' and implement them using span tags with class names.
You can find out more about them at: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons

If you want to write an id, remember to use camelCase.
If you want to write a class, remember to use dashes (example: this-is-a-class).
What about for a css file?

    <p class="lead">George Washington (/ˈdʒɔːrdʒ ˈwɒʃɪŋtən/; February 22, 1732 [O.S. February 11, 1731][b][c] – December 14, 1799) was an American politician and soldier who served as the first President of the United States from 1789 to 1797 and was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He served as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and later presided over the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution. He is popularly considered the driving force behind the nation's establishment and came to be known as the "father of the country," both during his lifetime and to this day.[2]</p>
    <p class="lead">Washington was widely admired for his strong leadership qualities and was unanimously elected president by the Electoral College in the first two national elections. He oversaw the creation of a strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won acceptance among Americans of all types.[3] Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr. President.[4][5] His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. The 22nd Amendment (1951) now limits the president to two elected terms.</p>
    <p class="lead">He was born into the provincial gentry of Colonial Virginia to a family of wealthy planters who owned tobacco plantations and slaves, which he inherited. In his youth, he became a senior officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the French and Indian War. In 1775, the Second Continental Congress commissioned him as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution. In that command, Washington forced the British out of Boston in 1776 but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he lost New York City.</p>
    <p class="lead">After crossing the Delaware River in the middle of winter, he defeated the British in two battles (Trenton and Princeton), retook New Jersey, and restored momentum to the Patriot cause. His strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at Saratoga in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781. Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals; preservation and command of the army; coordination with the Congress, state governors, and their militia; and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies.</p>
